## 📋 About Global-mouse

Global-mouse is a simple tool that lets you scroll through windows by holding down the middle mouse button and moving the mouse. It works everywhere on your computer, no matter which app or window you are using. This makes reading long documents, browsing webpages, or exploring large files easier and smoother.

The program runs quietly in the background and activates only when you press the middle mouse button, turning mouse movements into continuous scrolling. This is especially useful if your mouse or touchpad does not support smooth scrolling or if you want more control over scrolling speed.

Global-mouse is built with Python and designed to work on Windows systems. It uses simple controls so you don’t need coding skills to get it running.
